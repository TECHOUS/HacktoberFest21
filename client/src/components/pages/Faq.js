                        'If a repository maintainer decides a pull request you made was spammy or an unhelpful contribution to the project, they can add an invalid or spam label to your PR. This lets us know they do not think your pull request is a quality contribution, so it will not count toward Hacktoberfest.',
                        'In an effort to reduce spam and help maintainers, we’ve introduced a one week review period for all pull requests. Once you have submitted an eligible pull request (ready for review, not draft), the seven-day review window begins. This period gives maintainers time to identify and label any spammy pull requests as invalid. If your pull request is not marked invalid during that window, it will contribute toward the four you need to complete the Hacktoberfest challenge. If during this period your pull request is labeled as invalid, you will need to submit another eligible pull request (or resolve the issue with the current pull request), at which point the review period will start again.',

You can look for open issues labeled Hacktoberfest for inspiration. Quality contributions are encouraged! Are you maintaining a repo? Create issues or label existing ones with Hacktoberfest on your GitHub projects to help new contributors know what to work on. Tag any spam or irrelevant pull requests with the invalid label to disqualify them.',
